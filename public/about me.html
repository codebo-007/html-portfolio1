<h1> About Me!!</h1>
<hr>
<p>My name is tagbo omaliko but i go by Bo. I'm in the USN and as much as i love the navy 
    <br>the one thing everyone in the military can agree on is the pay as lower enlisted is trash lol.
     <br> So in the desire to seek a new side gig a freind of mine introduced me to the world of coding to me.</p>
<p>My desire to learn code was because of the good pay, remote work and flexibility it provided. 
    <br>It fit my lifestyle perfectly as i often get deployed and have extra duty through my career.
     <br>As i'm learning code i'm really starting to enjoy the process and Im hopeful in what this skill will bring to my life. </p>
